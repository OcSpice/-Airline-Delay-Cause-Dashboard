# Airline-Delay-Cause-Dashboard
This Tableau project analyzes U.S. airline flight delays using public Kaggle data. The dashboard highlights delay causes, airline performance, airport impacts, and time-based trends, giving stakeholders clear insights into why delays happen, where they occur most, and which airlines or airports contribute the most.

## 1. Introduction

This project analyzes airline flight delays using Tableau. The dashboard highlights the main causes of delays, airline performance, airport impacts, and overall delay trends over time.

**Purpose:**

- To identify which factors contribute most to delays.  
- To compare airlines and airports by delay patterns.  
- To give stakeholders a clear picture of delay behavior for decision-making.  

**Disclaimer:**  
This project is based on a public dataset and is for learning and demonstration purposes only. It does not represent any specific airline, airport, or government institution.

## 2. Problem Statement

The analysis seeks to answer the following key questions:

- What are the main causes of flight delays?  
- Which airlines contribute the most to delays?  
- Which airports experience the highest delays?  
- How do delays vary across time (year, month, season)?  

---

## 3. Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following Tableau concepts:

- Pivoting & calculated fields  
- KPI cards for high-level metrics  
- Dual-axis chart trick (donut visualization)  
- Interactive filters & actions (slicers)  
- Maps with geographic hierarchies  
- Dashboard design with custom background  

---

## 4. Data Sourcing

- **Dataset:** Airline_Delay_Cause.csv  
- Public dataset available via Kaggle.  
- Contains records of flights, delays, and delay causes.  

---

## 5. Data Transformation

Data preparation steps included:

- Pivoting delay cause columns into a single field.  
- Creating calculated fields,  

  ```text
  % Delayed Flights = SUM([arr_del15]) / SUM([arr_flights])
- Percentage of Delayed Flights
% Delayed Flights = SUM([arr_del15]) / SUM([arr_flights])

- Month Name (from numeric month)
  ```text
  Month Name = DATENAME('month', MAKEDATE(2000, [Month], 1))

- Year (from Year-Month Date field)
  ```text
  Year = YEAR([Year-Month Date])

- Top N Airlines Filter
INDEX() <= 10

Converting numeric months to proper month names using calculated field:

DATENAME('month', MAKEDATE(2000, [Month], 1))

Creating a Year field from Year-Month Date for hierarchy:

YEAR([Year-Month Date])

Applying Top N filter for airline analysis (Top 10).

## 6. Modeling

Since the dataset is flat, Tableau relationships were minimal. Key modeling included:

- Creating hierarchies (Year → Month → Date).

- Aggregations using calculated fields.

- KPIs combining flight totals and delays.



---

## 7. Analysis & Visualizations

- The dashboard consists of several visual components:

**KPI Cards**

- Total Flights

- Delayed Flights

- % of Flights Delayed

- Total Delay Minutes


**Delay Trends Over Time (Line Chart)**

- Tracks arrival delays across years.


**Delays by Airline (Stacked Bar, Top 10)**

- Compares carriers by total delays, color-coded by cause.


**Delays by Airport (Map)**

- Shows which airports experience the highest delays geographically.


**Donut Chart – Delay Causes Breakdown**

- Displays the percentage share of each delay factor.


**Delay Minutes by Cause (Bar Chart)**

- Highlights which causes drive the largest cumulative delay minutes.

## 8. Conclusion & Recommendations

**Insights:**

- Late Aircraft and Carrier delays account for the largest share of delay minutes.

- Weather delays are significant but less dominant compared to operational causes.

- Certain airlines (e.g., Southwest, American, Delta) consistently show higher delays.

- Delay trends peak in some years (2018–2019) and drop during events like 2020.


**Recommendations:**

- Airlines should focus on improving turnaround efficiency (Late Aircraft).

- Better carrier resource planning may reduce operational delays.

- Seasonal and weather-prone airports require proactive scheduling strategies.
